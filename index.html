    <p>This website will be use for conducting assignments for my CSC 106 course at the University Of Rhode Island with Instructors Faye_Wolf and Gauthier. 
       This website will be used as a portfolio for me to lear, explore, and attempt to master elements of programming using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Modules watched and challenges 
        performed on Khan Academy and information learned in class will be the primary learning materials in this endevor. I hope you enjpoy following the journey of failures, growth, 
        and progress that is "The Joy Of Programming"
